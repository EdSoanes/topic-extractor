Brandwatch Interview Question: Topics
-------------------------------------
This is a small app that's meant to extract interesting words and phrases from a body of text. It's not very good. Try and make one or two improvements,
and then zip the folder up and send to robs@brandwatch.com.

Some possible areas for improvement:

*  It only extracts words at the moment...
*  ...and the words it picks aren't very good
*  There are issues with how it splits the text into words
*  Everything's single-threaded. Is it possible to speed it up by splitting the job across threads?
*  Tests?
*  Other input methods?
